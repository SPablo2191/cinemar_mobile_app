# Cinemar
My first Flutter project based on [cinemar](https://github.com/SPablo2191/CinemarWeb) ,project released in 2022 and developed with angular (Front) and Flask(Back).

## Tips:
- you may need to add an .env file on the root directory in order to make it work; this project used env variables such as apiURL and apiKey and by using dotenv package of flutter, they are read from the file and used by the providers. The correct format is:
````
API_URL= <<URL>>
API_KEY = <<APIKEY>>
LANGUAGE =<<en-US>> english as default
````
